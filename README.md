Greetings!!!
The project attached to this README_2023.txt file is a complete brain child by solely Mr Tsaone Rantaung.The project intends to analyse Botswana 2019 population census and 2019 elections for the major settlements only. I chose Botswana because i am a motswana and my country is to embark yet again in another elections next year hence this was a relevant system to carryout. 

Description:
The enclosed data set is the complete, cleaned results of Botswana major settlemets 2019 population census and the population involvement in the country's elections in the same year. There are three files besides this README.md:
1. pdata.csv-which is the raw data that was use to carry this analysis.
2.botswana_population-checkpoint.ipynb which analysis the general population which at some point narrows down to Palapye settlement which is my home town.
3. BWpopulationvisualspp.py-this is a streamlit platform used to visualise part of the data analysis.
